# IngvQuake

### Requirements

- Ruby 2.5+

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ingv_quake'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ingv_quake



## Usage

#### Initialize the Client

Create a new instance of the `IngvQuake::Client` class to interact with the INGV Earthquake web services API:

```ruby
client = IngvQuake::Client.new
```

You can also provide a custom adapter for the underlying Faraday connection:

```ruby
client = IngvQuake::Client.new(adapter: httpx)
```
A curated list of supported adapters can be found in the [awesome-faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/awesome-faraday#adapters) repo


#### Get Events Data

Use the get_events method to initialize an EventResource and then fetch earthquake events from the API:

```ruby
events = client.get_events
```

The Ingv api can return 2 kinds of response format: `text` or `xml` (default).

#### Text response

The `text` response is a simplified representation of an event, containing basic information:

```
#EventID|Time|Latitude|Longitude|Depth/Km|Author|Catalog|Contributor|ContributorID|MagType|Magnitude|MagAuthor|EventLocationName|EventType
34726341|2023-04-19T14:50:48.640000|43.8972|11.9382|14.1|SURVEY-INGV||||ML|0.9|--|5 km NW Bagno di Romagna (FC)|earthquake
```
This response is parsed as a `BasicInfoEvent`

#### Xml response

  The `xml` response has all the information about an event.
  [Here an example](https://webservices.ingv.it/fdsnws/event/1/query?starttime=2023-04-25T00:00:00&endtime=2023-05-01T23:59:59&limit=5).

  This response is parsed as a `FullInfoEvent`

You can choose which level of information to get by passing or omitting the `format: 'text'` param when querying for events.

#### Query Events with Filters

The EventResource class provides several methods for querying events with specific filters. Here some examples:

#### By date range:
```ruby
events.between_dates(starttime: '2023-05-08', endtime: DateTime.now)
```

#### By magnitude range:
```ruby
events.between_magnitude(minmag: 3.5, maxmag: 6.0)
```

#### Within the last hour:
```ruby
events.within_last_hour
```

#### Custom Query
Use the where method to create a custom query with specific parameters:

```ruby
events.where(starttime: '2023-04-25', endtime: '2023-05-01', minmag: 4.5, maxmag: 6.0)
```
